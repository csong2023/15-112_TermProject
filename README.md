The goal of the project is to provide an entertaining, presentable game to the users that would be similar to Super Mario Maker, a Nintendo game. The game would consist of creator and play mode, where the user will start with the creator mode, creating the map for themselves, and then actually play inside the game as they transition to play mode. I am looking forward to a game that is smooth in terms of computational transitions and also an entertaining one with unique enemy features.

Main Features:
* Customization of the map 
* Playing inside the customized map
* Physics applied for movement of Mario and the rest of the enemy groups
